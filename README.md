About The Project
This project is part of a Kaggle competiton, where participants are given a train & test dataset, with the objective of trying to predict which loan would default. The target variable "loan_status", is labeled in the train dataset, but the test dataset does not have the target variable. 

By building a model using the train dataset, this model is then applied to the test dataset, and the model will predict whether or not a specific loan will default or not. 

# Getting Started
To use this depository, you will need to download the train, test and loan approval prediction files, and open them in your IDE or jupyter notebook. This project was run using Python.
